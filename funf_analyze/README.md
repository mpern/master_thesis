# Funf Analyze

Python scripts to analyze FunF data

Based on [version of funf_analyze.py by Carsten Draeger][gcode].

All scripts are converted to python3, therefore [PIL][pil] is replaced by [Pillow][pillow]

# Requirements

* [Pillow][pillow]
* [pycrypto][cryp]

Hint: pycrypto binaries for windows can be found at [voidspace.org.uk][void]
